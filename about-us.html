                <p class="animated fadeInUpShort delay-500" style="font-size:20px;color:gray;"> Affiliated Dialysis of California was created through a merger of Affiliated Dialysis and Home Dialysis Centers of Rancho Cucamonga.  The merger of Home Dialysis Centers and Affiliated Dialysis has brought expertise from leaders in both the home dialysis and nursing home dialysis care fields. Currently ADC is providing 10,000 nursing home dialysis treatments per month.  We are the industry leader and provide patient centric solutions with superior outcomes. </p>

                Our team has over 10 years servicing the needs of managed care in California.  ADC has gained the trust and the expertise to provide home hemodialysis services to the most complex patient cases coming out of acute hospital care for Kaiser, Caremore and others.  ADC has a deep understanding of the needs of managed care.  We provide superior clinical outcomes and reduce global expenditures.  ADC is the first and only home hemodialysis provider with solutions that are certified by both the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) and the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).

                Our dedicated home dialysis facilities provide patients and their caregivers with expert training and support to allow dialysis to be performed in the home setting. This allows the greatest individualization of the patients personalized dialysis treatment plan. Affiliated Dialysis California provides both home hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in the home setting.  Patients, families or other caregivers can be trained to do the treatments.  In some cases assistance can be provided at home.  ADC has special programs for high complexity patients, such as ventilator dependent patients and complex cardiac patients requiring mechanical support.

                Some dialysis patients require more care than can be provided at home but do not have need for acute hospital care. For this population, ADC of California can provide bedside hemodialysis in skilled nursing facilities.</p>

                Affiliated Dialysis California provides bedside hemodialysis in skilled nursing facilities. Our new program is the first and only Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) licensed provider of bedside dialysis in skilled nursing facilities in California. ADC of California works in conjunction with skilled nursing facilities  to support them in acquiring OSHPD and CDPH certification.  ADC provides a complete solution that includes; personnel, project management, program oversight, interdisciplinary care plans and equipment.  In addition, ADC can provide managed care contracting support.  We support skilled nursing facility dialysis because it is good for both patients and their care providers. Our staff can provide bedside dialysis for both ventilator dependent and your standard SNF patients.  Benefits include superior patient outcomes and elimination of transportation complexities. Transport to outside dialysis centers causes patients to miss medications, meals and therapy sessions. The comfort of being treated at the bedside in a skilled nursing facility is accompanied by improved patient survival.  Clinical data has shown patient mortality rates drop by 70% when transportation is eliminated.

We offer various forms of dialysis customized for patient’s individual treatment needs. Our philosophy is to make and keep patient's independent. We distinguish ourselves by interacting closely with our patients and their families.  We respect our patients as experts about their own lives and bodies.  We encourage open communication between our patient’s families and our staff, with all 
                parties held at equal status. Our team works with our patients as partners to improve both their quality of health and their quality of life.  Unlike the large corporate chains, every employee at ADC is empowered to fulfill their responsibility for providing unique solutions that meet the changing needs of our ESRD patients. Our staff is uniquely sensitive to the needs of our home dialysis patients.  Two of our home training Nurses have been home dialysis patients themselves and have now received successful transplants. These nurses are teaching patients about something that they lived themselves.

                <p class="" style="font-size:20px;color:gray; padding-top: 0px;">
                Patients who have end stage kidney failure and additional complex conditions can be difficult to place in outpatient dialysis facilities. Examples include ventilator dependent patients and cardiac patients with continuous mechanical or chemical support needs. These complex patients often get trapped in acute care hospitals where they may stay many months or even years because very few outpatient dialysis facilities will accept these types of patients. When there is the support necessary in their homes, some complex patients can get out of medical facilities and return home with ADC providing the dialysis support. We have a long track record of bringing patients home who were previously considered non dischargeable patients. ADC provides assistance in coordinating care with other disciplines and caregivers of all levels. Our physicians do home visits. Most cases of this nature require a dialysis nurse or licensed patient care technician be provided by ADC to perform the dialysis treatment. When appropriate, family members may be trained to be the Dialysis Care Giver.

                When patients do not have adequate support in their home setting the other alternative becomes bedside Dialysis in a skilled nursing facility where ADC is contracted to provide dialysis support.</p>

                <p class="" style="font-size:20px;color:gray; padding-top: 0px;">
                This type of dialysis is performed 6 to 8 hours at night, Usually every other night or up to five nights per week while the patient is sleeping. Nocturnal home dialysis is more like normal kidney function because it is done for longer periods of time as well as more often than conventional in center three times a week dialysis.  It is the form of hemodialysis that delivers the greatest toxin and fluid removal. All of the benefits of More Frequent Dialysis are gained but even more so as the dose of dialysis increases greatly with nocturnal dialysis.

                <p class="" style="font-size:20px;color:gray; padding-top: 0px;">
                PD is home dialysis treatment that uses the patients peritoneum (which is the inner lining of your abdomen) as a filter to exchange fluid and dissolved substances and toxins from the blood. In this case fluid is introduced through a catheter or a tube that's permanently placed in the abdomen. The newly instilled clean fluid absorbs the toxins from the body and then is removed and new clean fluid is instilled into the abdomen again. When this is done manually we call that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or CAPD.  A machine or a cycler can also do it at night while the patient is sleeping, referred to as Automated Peritoneal Dialysis.
